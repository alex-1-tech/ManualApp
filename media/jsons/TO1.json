Visually inspect all cables for cuts, abrasions, and exposed wires.\n2. Check the connectors: contacts must be clean, without signs of oxidation.\n3. Inspect the prisms and optical surfaces of the probes for cracks, chips, and deep scratches.\n4. Clean the encoder wheel.\n5. Gently wipe the prisms with a lint-free cloth, if necessary, lightly moistened with alcohol (do not flood).\n6. If damage is found, replace the cable or connector."
